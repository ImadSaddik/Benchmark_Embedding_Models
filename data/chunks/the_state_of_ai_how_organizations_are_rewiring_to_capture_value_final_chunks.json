While still in early days, companies are redesigning workflows, elevating governance, and mitigating more risks.\n\nOrganizations are starting to make organizational changes designed to generate future value from gen AI, and large companies are leading the way. The latest McKinsey Global Survey on AI finds that organizations are beginning to take steps that drive bottom-line impact\u2014for example, redesigning workflows as they deploy gen AI and putting senior leaders in critical roles, such as overseeing AI governance. The findings also show that organizations are working to mitigate a growing set of gen-AI-related risks and are hiring for new AI-related roles while they retrain employees to participate in AI deployment. Companies with at least $500 million in annual revenue are changing more quickly than smaller organizations. Overall, the use of AI\u2014that is, gen AI as well as analytical AI\u2014continues to build momentum: More than three-quarters of respondents now say that their organizations use AI in at least one business function. The use of gen AI in particular is rapidly increasing."

Twenty-eight percent of respondents whose organizations use AI report that their CEO is responsible for overseeing AI governance, though the share is smaller at larger organizations with $500 million or more in annual revenues, and 17 percent say AI governance is overseen by their board of directors. In many cases, AI governance is jointly owned: On average, respondents report that two leaders are in charge.\n\nThe value of AI comes from rewiring how companies run, and the latest survey shows that, out of 25 attributes tested for organizations of all sizes, the redesign of workflows has the biggest effect on an organization\u2019s ability to see EBIT impact from its use of gen AI.

The background is a light blue with abstract digital art.\n\nMcKinsey commentary\nAlexander Sukharevsky\nSenior partner and global coleader of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey\n\nThe more we see organizations using AI, the more we recognize that it takes a top-down process to really move the needle. Effective AI implementation starts with a fully committed C-suite and, ideally, an engaged board. Many companies\u2019 instinct is to delegate implementation to the IT or digital department, but over and over again, this turns out to be a recipe for failure.\n\nThere are several reasons for this. The first is that getting real value out of AI requires transformation, not just new technology. It\u2019s a question of successful change management and mobilization, which is why C-suite leadership is essential. It\u2019s also a potentially expensive transformation, requiring intensive use of sometimes scarce resources and talent. A lot rides on how those resources are made available, and that\u2019s an executive-level call requiring nuanced decision-making that reflects the balance organizations must strike between efficient resource use and broad empowerment\u2014a balance that must be constantly reevaluated as the technology and organization evolve.\n\nAs organizations become more fluent with AI, it will essentially become embedded in all functions, leaving leadership to focus on higher-level tasks like impact monitoring and talent development rather than on implementation."

The background is a light blue with abstract digital art.\n\nMcKinsey commentary\nAlex Singla\nSenior partner and global coleader of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey\n\nWe\u2019ve learned a lot about generative AI over the past two years. But perhaps the most important lesson is this: It pays to think big. The organizations that are building a genuine and lasting competitive advantage from their AI efforts are the ones that are thinking in terms of wholesale transformative change that stands to alter their business models, cost structures, and revenue streams\u2014rather than proceeding incrementally.\n\nOur experience helping organizations create and deploy gen AI systems also shows that it pays to be ambitious from the outset\u2014pursuing end-to-end solutions to transform entire domains, rather than taking a piecemeal, use-case-by-use-case approach. Beginning with an overarching, enterprise-level transformative vision opens up possibilities down the line. That\u2019s because a clear picture of where you\u2019re going influences the data you capture and the models you build. You\u2019re thinking about things like access control; security; reusability of code at the front end, not as an afterthought; and creating a foundational infrastructure that is well beyond any individual use case or domain. This allows further functionality to be deployed faster and more cheaply than if you go use case by use case\u2014which, in turn, becomes a competitive advantage that others will have a hard time keeping up with.\n\nTransformative thinking also forces the CEO and top team to be aligned\u2014something that use case thinking does not. This is critical because successful transformations require siloed parts of the enterprise to come together in a single orchestrated effort\u2014and that can typically only happen when the CEO and other top leaders are involved.\n\nRespondents at larger organizations report mitigating more gen-AI-related risks than other respondents do."

One significant difference is that these companies focus as much on driving adoption and scaling as they do on the up-front technology development. This is not just hand-waving. Instead, they are following specific management practices that enable them to be successful\u2014such as developing a clear road map for scaling, establishing and tracking KPIs, and driving change management by ensuring senior leaders are actively engaged in driving gen AI adoption. The fact that so many companies continue to struggle with these management practices is a testament to the fact that they\u2019re not so simple to get right.\n\nIn addition, companies that report capturing value from gen AI are \u201crewiring\u201d their business processes to effectively embed gen AI solutions while appropriately incorporating human-in-the-loop mechanisms to validate models and outputs and effectively mitigating risks associated with the technology."

She is smiling and looking slightly to her left. The background is a light blue with abstract digital art.\n\nMcKinsey commentary\nLareina Yee\nSenior partner and McKinsey Global Institute director\n\nAlthough we remain in the early stages of gen AI, we\u2019re beginning to get a glimpse into the ways the technology is affecting the workforce. A common fear about the technology is that it will be a job killer, as organizations offload tasks historically done by employees to increasingly powerful AI platforms. But our survey suggests that this is not necessarily the case. In fact, a plurality of respondents anticipate no immediate change to the size of their workforces. And while respondents expect lower head counts in some functions\u2014such as service operations and supply chain/inventory management\u2014in other functions\u2014including software engineering and product development\u2014respondents are actually anticipating an increase in the number of employees.\n\nMeantime, the difficulty of finding AI talent, while still considerable, is beginning to ease. Perhaps more people are taking the initiative to enhance their own capabilities. Or it could be that corporate investments in upskilling are beginning to bear fruit. Both of these somewhat counterintuitive trends serve to reinforce the fact that we are still in the early days of the AI revolution\u2014the long-term workforce effects are still only beginning to take shape."

Respondents most often report using the technology in the IT and marketing and sales functions, followed by service operations. The business function that saw the largest increase in AI use in the past six months is IT, where the share of respondents reporting AI use jumped from 27 percent to 36 percent.\n\nOrganizations are also using AI in more business functions than in the previous State of AI survey. For the first time, most survey respondents report the use of AI in more than one business function (Exhibit 9). Responses show organizations using AI in an average of three business functions\u2014an increase from early 2024, but still a minority of functions.\n\n\u00b3The survey question asked, \"In which business functions has your organization adopted AI (for example, machine learning, computer vision, natural-language processing)?\" Eleven business functions were offered as answer choices. Organizations using AI are those that, according to respondents, have adopted AI in at least one business function. For the purposes of our research, we left \"adopted\" undefined. Use of AI, therefore, spans from early experimentation by a few employees to AI being embedded across multiple business units that have entirely redesigned their business processes.\n\n***\n\n**Exhibit 8**\n**Organizations\u2019 use of AI has accelerated markedly in the past year, after years of little meaningful change.**\nA description of a line chart showing the percentage of respondents whose organizations use AI in at least 1 business function, from 2017 to 2024.\n\n*   The line for \"Use of AI\" shows a general upward trend: 2017 (47%), 2018 (58%), 2019 (50%), 2020 (50%), 2021 (56%), 2022 (50%), 2023 (55%), early 2024 (72%), late 2024 (78%).\n*   A second line for \"Use of gen AI\" appears in 2023, starting at 33%, and increasing to 65% in early 2024 and 71% in late 2024.\n\n\u00b9In 2017, the definition for AI use was using AI in a core part of the organization\u2019s business or at scale. In 2018\u201319, the definition was embedding at least 1 AI capability in business processes or products.

Compared with early 2024, larger shares of respondents say that their organizations\u2019 gen AI use cases have increased revenue within the business units deploying them (Exhibit 12). Respondents report similar revenue increases from gen AI as they did from analytical AI activities in the previous survey. This emphasizes the need for companies to have a comprehensive approach across both AI and gen AI solutions to capture the full potential value.\n\n**Exhibit 12**\n**Organizations increasingly see gen AI\u2019s effects on revenues in the business units using the technology.**\nA description of a grouped bar chart showing the \"Revenue increase within business units from gen AI use, past 12 months, by function,\" as a percentage of respondents.

In early 2024, among respondents reporting use of gen AI in specific business functions, a minority saw cost reductions from its use.\u2076 The latest survey finds that, for use of gen AI in most business functions, a majority of respondents report cost reductions. Yet gen AI\u2019s reported effects on bottom-line impact are not yet material at the enterprise-wide level. More than 80 percent of respondents say their organizations aren\u2019t seeing a tangible impact on enterprise-level EBIT from their use of gen AI.\u2077\n\n\u2076Use in HR was the exception, with half of respondents who reported gen AI use in HR saying it had reduced costs.\n\u2077Seventeen percent of respondents say 5 percent or more of their organization\u2019s EBIT in the past 12 months is attributable to the use of gen AI.\n\n***\n\n**Exhibit 13**\n**Respondents increasingly report cost reductions from gen AI within business units using the technology.**\nA description of two sets of horizontal bar charts showing the \"Cost decrease within business units from gen AI use, past 12 months, by function,\" comparing the first half of 2024 with the second half of 2024.\n\n**First half of 2024**\n*   **Supply chain and inventory management:** 46% total decrease.\n*   **Service operations:** 45% total decrease.\n*   **Strategy and corporate finance:** 38% total decrease.\n*   **HR:** 50% total decrease.\n*   **Software engineering:** 42% total decrease.\n*   **Risk, legal, and compliance:** 33% total decrease.\n*   **Marketing and sales:** 37% total decrease.\n*   **IT:** 42% total decrease.\n*   **Product or service development:** 37% total decrease.\n*   **Knowledge management:** 34% total decrease.\n\n**Second half of 2024**\n*   **Supply chain and inventory management:** 61% total decrease.\n*   **Service operations:** 58% total decrease.\n*   **Strategy and corporate finance:** 56% total decrease.\n*   **HR:** 56% total decrease.\n*   **Software engineering:** 52% total decrease.\n*   **Risk, legal, and compliance:** 51% total decrease.\n*   **Marketing and sales:** 47% total decrease.\n*   **IT:** 43% total decrease.\n*   **Product or service development:** 43% total decrease.\n*   **Knowledge management:** 43% total decrease.\n\n\u00b9Question was asked only of respondents who said their organizations use gen AI in a given function.

The background is a light blue with abstract digital art.\n\nMcKinsey commentary\nMichael Chui\nSenior fellow\n\nThings are moving fast in the field of AI. But even as we try to keep up with the pace of technological advancements, we are also learning that AI only makes an impact in the real world when enterprises adapt to the new capabilities that these technologies enable. That\u2019s what we are hearing in our individual conversations with business leaders\u2014and it is also reflected in the global data we have collected in our latest survey.\n\nSince our previous state of AI survey, the use of AI has continued to increase. More companies are using AI in a growing number of business functions. They are using gen AI to reinvent aspects of their enterprises: marketing and sales, product and service development, service operations, corporate IT, and software engineering. More of our survey respondents are reporting top-line and cost benefits from deploying gen AI solutions. And more respondents say they are using gen AI in their daily lives. Interestingly, it\u2019s C-level executives who are leading in their own use, but their employees could be much more ready to use gen AI at work than their C-suite leaders expect.\n\nOrganizations have been experimenting with gen AI tools. Use continues to surge, but from a value capture standpoint, these are still early days\u2014few are experiencing meaningful bottom-line impacts. Larger companies are doing more organizationally to help realize that value. They invest more heavily in AI talent. They mitigate more gen-AI-related risks. We have seen organizations move since early last year, and the technology also continues to evolve, with a view toward agentic AI as the next frontier for AI innovation. It will be interesting to see what happens when more companies begin to follow the road map for successful gen AI implementation in 2025 and beyond."
