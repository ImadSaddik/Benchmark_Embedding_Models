    "text_chunk": "Battery safety information\n\nBattery protection\n*   Frequently charging a battery under high voltage may shorten the battery life. To protect the battery, once the battery is fully charged, the system may stop charging when the battery power is between 90% and 100%.\n    NOTE: The level at which the battery resumes charging is usually set between 90% and 99%. The actual value may vary by model.\n*   Charging or storing a battery in high ambient temperatures may result in permanent damage to the battery power capacity and rapidly shorten battery life. If the battery temperature is too high, the system may reduce the battery power charging capacity or even stop charging to protect the battery.\n*   Battery power capacity may drop even when your device is powered off and disconnected from the AC power. This is normal as the system still draws a small amount of power from the battery.\n\nStandard battery care\n*   If you are not using your device for a long period of time, ensure to charge the battery power to 50% then power off your device and disconnect the AC power adapter. Recharge the battery power to 50% every three months to avoid over-discharging and prevent damage to the battery.\n*   Avoid charging the battery at high voltage for a prolonged period of time to extend the battery life. If you are constantly using AC power for your device, ensure to discharge the battery power to 50% at least once every two weeks. You can also adjust the settings from Battery Health Charging in MyASUS to help extend the battery life.\n*   It is recommended to store your battery at temperatures between 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F) and 35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F) with the battery power at 50%. You can also adjust the settings from Battery Health Charging in MyASUS to help extend the battery life.\n*   Do not leave your battery in damp environments. Exposure to damp environments may increase the battery over-discharging rate. Low temperature environment may damage the chemicals inside the battery while high temperature or overheating may result in a risk of explosion.\n*   Do not place your device or battery pack near radiators, fireplaces, furnaces, heaters, or any sources of heat with temperature exceeding 60\u00b0C (140\u00b0F). High temperature surrounding environment may result in an explosion or leakage that may cause fire."

Operation is subject to the following two conditions:\n*   This device may not cause harmful interference.\n*   This device must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation.\n\nThis equipment has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a class B digital device, pursuant to Part 15 of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference in a residential installation. This equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio frequency energy and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instructions, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. However, there is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular installation. If this equipment does cause harmful interference to radio or television reception, which can be determined by turning the equipment off and on, the user is encouraged to try to correct the interference by one or more of the following measures:\n*   Reorient or relocate the receiving antenna.\n*   Increase the separation between the equipment and receiver.\n*   Connect the equipment into an outlet on a circuit different from that to which the receiver is connected. \n*   Consult the dealer or an experienced radio/TV technician for help.\n\nWARNING! The use of a shielded-type power cord is required in order to meet FCC emission limits and to prevent interference to the nearby radio and television reception. It is essential that only the supplied power cord be used. Use only shielded cables to connect I/O devices to this equipment.
