It took Google over a decade to surpass a billion queries a day\u00b9. ChatGPT reached that number in just two years\u00b2.\n\nAI's rapid pace, seemingly taking over businesses and news cycles overnight, makes you wonder if the whole thing is just hype. In fact, that's what we expected to find when we started off on this survey. We couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nWhen the results came back, it turned out that businesses are actually underestimating the positive impact AI will have on their operations.\n\nOur January 2025 survey of over 1,000 managers and business leaders found that AI adoption is well underway across business operations. We learned who is ahead of the curve and who is struggling to catch up. We also uncovered some key information on how different businesses are using AI to contribute to their success, giving them a crucial competitive edge.\n\nKey Takeaways: AI adoption is underway across businesses, and the outlook is positive\n\nAI adoption rates are high and climbing quickly\nOur survey found that 28% of businesses are already using AI, and another 45% have active implementation plans underway.\n\nBusinesses are very optimistic about AI's potential impact\nOf the businesses surveyed, 28% expected AI to have a transformational impact, and 59% believed its impact would be somewhat positive.\n\nIn real-life use, businesses report AI's transformational impact is even higher\nOf the population that has already adopted AI, 51% report that it has had a transformational impact on their operations.\n\nBusinesses using AI are planning to increase their investment in 2025\n34% of businesses planning to use AI plan to spend over $100,000, while 57% of those already actively using AI in their operations plan to spend $100,000 or more.\n\nTech companies and IT teams are at the front of the curve\nThey're adopting AI faster, using more integrated AI tools like custom agents (72% of tech companies already have AI agents deployed), and reporting higher levels of success with them. Other industries\u2014such as construction, manufacturing, and retail\u2014face challenges like lack of knowledge, internal conflict, and tools that won't integrate with legacy systems.

    "text_chunk": "Tools: How are businesses implementing AI?\nWe found that the majority of AI adoption is being driven top-down. Almost three-quarters of the tools respondents are using are supplied to them by their company. Just a quarter of respondents are using AI tools they'd sought out on their own.\n\n[Image: A concentric circle diagram titled \"Most AI tools in use are being deployed top-down\".]\n[Description of the diagram:]\nThe chart asks \"Who deployed the AI tools you are using?

Interestingly, integration is also reported as a major challenge for many businesses, which we will discuss later in this report. Businesses also highly value AI output quality, data privacy, and security in an AI vendor.\n\n[Image: A ranked list titled \"Businesses need AI that integrates with their existing systems\".]\n[Description of the list:]\nThe list answers the question \"What do you value most in an AI vendor?\".

End-user ease-of-use\n6. Customization flexibility\n7. Implementation timeline\n\nMost businesses appear to be starting their AI journey with the most easily accessible tools available to them. Both AI Adopters and AI Planners report their top-used tools as Generative AI platforms, AI features within existing platforms, and new AI offerings from existing vendors.\n\nThis isn't surprising since generative AI platforms like ChatGPT are both the most widely discussed tools and the easiest to access, with many accessible for free online. Lots of existing tools have also been jumping on the AI bandwagon, so workers are likely to have easy access to AI features and new tools from the software they're already relying on for work.\n\nThis is also true when we look at what tools are being self-selected vs implemented top-down by a company or team. AI content generation tools are the most common tool implemented on an individual level (70%) but less common for companies to provide. Tools like ChatGPT, Jasper, and Perplexity are easy for any worker to access and don't require any setup to use. However, they aren't able to use company-specific data or integrate with processes where a business needs efficiency gains.\n\nSuccess: What tools are businesses finding most effective?\nMore targeted solutions, custom-built tools, and tools that are more integrated into business data are harder to roll out but are also correlated with higher levels of success.\n\nWhen looking at the tools AI Adopters are finding to be transformational, AI tools that have been custom-built using a no code platform top the list at 59%, along with new tools from existing vendors (54%).\n\n[Image: A horizontal bar chart titled \"Tools built with no/low code platforms report the most transformational impact\".]\n[Description of the chart:]\nThe chart shows the percentage of businesses finding a transformational impact from various types of AI tools.\n- Custom-built AI solutions using no/low code platforms: 59%\n- New AI offerings from existing vendors: 54%\n- AI features within existing platforms: 53%\n- AI-first solutions for specific use cases: 52%\n- Generative AI platforms: 52%\n- Custom-built AI solutions with code: 42%\n\nBusinesses report the highest transformational impact from research and brainstorming, data processing, and process automation.

In 5 years they will be transforming our business.\nI expect our usage to increase to keep up with competition.\nI'm skeptical that they will be as effective as what is being promised currently. I believe there will not be fully autonomous AI and instead require decent human interaction or support.\nI think we will be developing our own agents in-house. I can see us using them for everything from sales and marketing content creation to human resources, data mining, and customer interaction.\nI expect our company to grow with the help of AI agents.\nOver the next year, I see my company using AI agents to automate routine tasks and enhance customer support. In five years, I envision AI agents becoming more advanced, handling complex decision-making, personalizing customer experiences, and driving innovation in our operations.\n\nThe deeper businesses progress into AI adoption, the more they need tools that address specific pain points, use their unique data, and integrate seamlessly into their existing processes. The way many businesses are choosing to implement this type of AI is with AI agents.\n\nAccording to Gartner, \"AI agents are autonomous or semiautonomous software entities that use AI techniques to perceive, make decisions, take actions, and achieve goals.\" They are typically more customized since they need to work with the unique needs of the businesses deploying them.\n\n47% of businesses that have implemented AI are already using AI agents\n\n[Image: A donut chart titled \"94% of businesses that have adopted AI are also using AI agents or planning to\".]\n[Description of the chart:]\nThe chart is a segmented ring. In the center, text reads \"94% are using AI agents or planning to\". The ring is divided into three colored sections, each with a percentage and a corresponding legend entry.\n- A dark teal section representing 47% is labeled \"Using AI agents\".\n- A light teal section representing 47% is labeled \"Not using AI agents, but plan to this year\".\n- A small grey section representing 6% is labeled \"Not using AI agents, and have no plans\".\n\nThe vast majority of businesses using AI are also either already using AI agents (47%) or have plans to (47%).\n\nMost have deployed more than one agent, with 78% reporting they are currently using between 2 and 10 AI agents. Agent usage follows the same trends as general AI use along business size, with Enterprises 41% more likely to report using agents and using a higher number of agents within their businesses.\n\nAI agents make it possible to use AI more effectively for the tasks that businesses report to be the most transformational, such as data processing, process automation, and business intelligence. These are also the tasks that are hardest to address with lower-barrier AI tools.\n\n[Image: A dual-section infographic titled \"Where businesses are employing AI agents\".]\n[Description of the infographic:]\nThe infographic is split into two columns: \"Departments\" on the left and \"Use Cases\" on the right. Each column contains a series of lozenge shapes with a percentage and a label.\n**Departments:**\n- 59% IT\n- 52% Customer Service / Support\n- 43% Operations\n- 35% HR\n- 35% Sales/BD\n- 33% Marketing\n- 30% Admin\n- 27% Finance/Accounting\n- 21% Software Engineering\n**Use Cases:**\n- 53% Data processing\n- 51% Process automation\n- 48% Customer-facing chatbot\n- 46% Business intelligence\n- 45% Document processing\n- 44% Content generation\n- 43% Research & brainstorming\n- 39% Internal knowledge management\n- 32% Code development\n\nAlmost half of the businesses using AI agents found they have had a transformational impact on their work. The two use cases performing above average are data processing (52% report transformational) and process automation (52% transformational).\n\n55% partner with consultants to build custom AI agents\nThe top-reported barrier to deploying AI agents is a lack of knowledge. Over half of businesses report struggling with this. Cost also climbs the list compared to general AI use\u2014more customized solutions can be expensive, especially if they involve software development. Data privacy is a much lower priority at this stage of AI adoption.\n\n[Image: A horizontal bar chart titled \"Lack of knowledge is a major barrier to deploying AI agents\".]\n[Description of the chart:]\nThe chart shows the biggest concerns when implementing AI agents.\n- Lack of knowledge: 54%\n- Costs: 44%\n- Employee resistance: 31%\n- Leadership buy-in: 26%\n- Data privacy and security concerns: 26%\n- Lack of engineering resources: 14%\n\nOverall, the two most popular approaches to building AI agents involve customization and the support of an outside expert. Over half of businesses report to have built AI agents using third-party consultants or vendors.\n\nAnother large portion of agents were purchased pre-built but customizable to that business's unique needs in-house. Both approaches allow businesses to benefit from a company or developer's specialized knowledge to help them understand how to deploy their agents effectively.\n\n[Image: A horizontal bar chart titled \"55% of businesses using AI agents built custom agents with the help of a third-party consultant or vendor\".]\n[Description of the chart:]\nThe chart displays how businesses are building or acquiring AI agents.\n- Used a third-party consultant or vendor to build it: 55%\n- Purchased a pre-built solution and customized it in-house: 48%\n- Built entirely in-house: 29%\n- Built with a no/low code platform: 27%\n- Purchased an off-the-shelf solution: 26%\n\nNon-customizable off-the-shelf solutions and fully custom-built agents without outside help are the least used approaches.\n\nWhile fewer agents are being built from scratch, businesses use more agents when they can develop their own\nBusinesses building their own AI agents are also significantly more likely to be using a larger number of agents in their operations. This group is split evenly between building their AI agents with code and using the support of no/low code tools.\n\n[Image: An infographic with several text boxes and statistics about building AI agents with no code.]\n[Description of the infographic:]\nThe central theme is \"AI agents built with no code\".\n- A box states: \"Businesses building custom AI agents with the help of no code\" are \"Most likely to have a transformational impact on business operations\" and are \"Least likely to be considered by slow AI adopters\".\n- Another box indicates that \"24% of businesses using no code for custom agents have 11+ AI agents\".\n- A third box shows that \"67% are using mostly or fully autonomous AI agents\".\n\nThis correlation may indicate that giving teams the ability to build and customize their own AI tools helps them use more of them in their work. When teams don't have to rely on sourcing vendors and hiring outside developers, they can more quickly apply AI to address specific challenges as they come up.\n\nBusinesses developing their own AI agents with no/low code tools are also 33% more likely to report their agents are fully autonomous than those acquiring them in other ways. It may be that this type of platform-supported development encourages trust in AI tools.\n\nThe software/tech industry is more willing to build AI agents with no/low code platforms (40%) or in-house with code (39%) when compared to other industries, which could be another reason why tech is reporting higher levels of success with AI than other industries.\n\nAI agents are used more by larger and more technical businesses\nAI agent adoption follows the same trend as general AI adoption, with larger companies using more agents. More than half of Enterprise organizations are actively using AI agents compared to only one-third of small businesses.\n\nEnterprise organizations are also using a larger number of AI agents, with 26% having 11+ agents deployed compared to 3% of small businesses and 9% of midsized businesses.\n\nStill, over 90% of all businesses using AI currently indicate that they are either actively using AI agents or planning to deploy them this year, so small and mid-sized businesses are quickly catching up.\n\nTrends by industry also follow the same patterns as general AI adoption. Tech is adopting at the highest rate, with 72% having already deployed agents, followed by manufacturing in second (45%).\n\n[Image: A bubble chart titled \"Tech is way ahead of the adoption curve with AI agents\".]\n[Description of the chart:]\nThe chart, subtitled \"AI agent use by industry\", shows five bubbles of varying sizes, each representing an industry and its AI agent adoption rate.\n- Technology: 72%\n- Manufacturing: 45%\n- Retail: 43%\n- Construction: 42%\n- Other: 37%"

    "text_chunk": "Challenges and barriers to AI adoption\nWhile overall, businesses are finding a lot of success with AI, there are still many barriers and challenges they're facing. Internal conflicts are happening within many organizations, not every leader feels fully informed about where to use AI or how to integrate it, and data privacy and security concerns persist across the board.\n\nSecurity is a dealbreaker\n\nWhat people are saying about AI security\nI think they need assurances that it is safe and will protect our data.\nI need to know what it's totally capable of before implementing it into our HR system in order to avoid risking the company data.\nAll we have is just some privacy concerns we're afraid that the more information we put into it the more information that the AI will have about our customers.\nI need to know a few years down the line, people's data will still be safe.\nThe tools currently available don't meet our security standards sufficiently.\n\nHalf of the businesses surveyed cite data privacy and security concerns as their top barrier to AI adoption.\n\nInterestingly, security seems to be primarily table stakes for most businesses rather than a differentiator. Satisfying security standards is a non-negotiable when choosing to roll out an AI tool, but once businesses are satisfied that standards are being met, attention shifts to other factors.\n\nAs businesses get deeper into AI implementation and move from experimenting with generative AI platforms towards more integrated solutions like AI agents, security drops significantly in the list of stated concerns.\n\nLack of knowledge is the biggest challenge for many business leaders\n\nWhat people don't know about AI\nI am confused about how to use it to its optimal efficiency and don't know where to begin.\nIt is innovative but hard to understand.\nI feel like I need to learn more about how it works.\nI would like to have videos to see how other companies are doing this.\nI'm not sure how this will exactly play into my career at this point.\nI don't really understand which functions can best be addressed by AI, so we're basically going by trial and error.\nI just need to see examples of AI working with other businesses to prove that it's beneficial and increases revenue.\nI feel like there is quite a bit we still need to learn about AI. Part of the problem is, in a lot of ways, we don't yet know what we need to learn in order to move forward with AI.\nMore specific examples and data are needed to show how companies across various industries have implemented AI to improve their operations.\n\nI need to know how AI will help my work, how to set it up, how it keeps my data safe, if it will grow with my needs, and if the benefits are worth the cost...\n\nLack of knowledge is a barrier to successful AI adoption for all three surveyed groups:\n- For AI Rejectors, lack of knowledge is the number one reason for their organization's resistance to AI. This uncertainty seems to lead many businesses to pass on AI, and many of them describe wanting to wait and see how it develops before trying it.\n- A large portion of AI Planners want to implement AI but aren't sure where to start. This group makes up 19% of our total surveyed respondents.\n- AI Adopters report challenges with more specific knowledge around AI use cases, tools, and approaches as they deepen their investment in AI. With implementing more custom solutions like AI agents, lack of knowledge supercedes security concerns, with 54% of businesses reporting lack of knowledge to be their top issue with rolling out AI agents.\n\nSmaller businesses seem to have a harder time gaining knowledge about AI, with 30% reporting they want to implement AI but don't know how compared to 18% of midsized companies and just 12% of Enterprises.\n\nIntegration with existing tools and processes is a barrier to practical AI implementation\n\nWhat people are saying about AI integration\nOur information and assets are strewn across so many databases. We never know where to find the resources we have and need \u2014 we just don't know where to look. It seems like AI could help us find it, but I don't know how.\nCompatibility with legacy systems.\n(We need to know) how to integrate it into existing systems without disrupting what is already working.\nOur systems are old and not compatible with AI.\nI wish AI could more seamlessly integrate with existing systems and provide real-time, highly personalized insights without complex setup or training.\n\n\"Integration with our systems\" is ranked the number one factor businesses value in an AI vendor\u2014ahead of output quality, security, and cost. As businesses move from considering whether or not to use AI to planning rollout and finding the right tools, concerns about disrupting existing processes and finding tools that work with legacy systems become more important.\n\nSome industries are having a harder time figuring out how to use AI\n\nWhat industries are having AI challenges\nI would love to use more of it but don't know how it can apply to the construction industry.\nThere isn't really a use for it in construction. We still need laborers to do the work, a robot cannot do it.\nThere aren't a lot of processes in our company that we can use AI for.\nI don't know how AI can help identify potential job applicants or potential subscribers to our publication.\nSecurity concerns. Trust in AI's quality output. No solutions for delivering goods in the logistics industry.\n\nAI implementation levels vary widely between industries. Understandably, the tech industry is significantly further in the AI adoption journey than others. Less tech-forward industries and labor-intensive fields have much lower levels of AI adoption and report struggling the most with a lack of knowledge and difficulty finding uses for AI within their businesses.\n\n[Image: A ranked list titled \"Industries least likely to have any AI tools or AI agents implemented\".]\n[Description of the list:]\nThe image displays a numbered list from 1 to 5, with each item in a separate colored bar.\n1. Freight\n2. Hospitality\n3. Real estate\n4. Media\n5. Construction\n\nTransportation & logistics and manufacturing seem to have the hardest time identifying what AI technologies to use, with 19% and 17%, respectively, reporting that they have plans to implement AI but haven't yet been able to identify which tools they will use.\n\nThe outlook across industries on AI's potential impact is largely positive, with no industry reporting less than 65% positive outlook anticipation, despite some reporting challenges in figuring out how to harness that impact.\n\nInternal conflicts are slowing down AI adoption\n\nWhat people are saying about internal AI conflicts\nWe need to get our upper management convinced about AI.\nThere are so many tools and functions - I'm satisfied with the output, but others in the org need convincing.\nI know how to use AI, I'm a millennial. I use ChatGPT almost daily and Copilot. It is our older employees who have no clue how to use it for efficiency.\nI am completely comfortable using AI, it's mostly people who don't understand the technology that have an issue.\nI think the problem is more in convincing the other department heads and upper management of its positive effects for us. I have done some research, and I see a lot of positive changes in AI for us.\nThe biggest obstacle...is convincing some others of its beneficial impact it will have on all phases of our processes. It would stop the repetitive data entry, the statistical analysis of issues. It could brainstorm when we are facing a problem that seems catastrophic. It can do so many functions that I think the others don't believe it's capable of doing.\n\nQualitative data also shows that there are conflicts within organizations that are slowing down AI adoption.\n\nA frequent and repeated blocker reported by internal champions of AI is resistance from upper management. Generational divides play a role. Millennials and younger employees describe themselves as already enthusiastically using AI at work, while older leadership doesn't understand or see the value in AI technology.\n\nLeaders who are skeptical about AI adoption or unsure of its value may want to consult their existing teams, especially early-adopting technical teams, to hear their experiences and ideas around AI adoption."

    "text_chunk": "Will AI take our jobs? Concerns exist throughout businesses\n\nWhat people are saying about AI & job concerns\nI'm worried about the future of my workers if AI gets to where we don't need them anymore.\nI'm trying to be a team player but I can easily see how this will replace a lot of people's jobs, a lot of friends that I've made at work.\nThe fact it would put many people within the company out of work is another reason we are walking away from AI at the moment.\nPersonally, I am very comfortable using it. There are people who believe AI will replace them, so they resist.\nWhile I can arguably see the pro side of AI I feel the cons outweigh them by a fair amount. Especially when considering privacy/safety and job replacement implications.\n\n13% of survey respondents mention job loss as a fear they have around AI adoption. Some mention concern for their own jobs, but many leaders are also concerned with losing their teams or colleagues. They also mention ethical concerns and worry about the impact on customer experience. Some leaders even report deciding not to use AI because they don't want to reduce their team size.\n\nManagers express the most concern about being replaced by AI and are the most distrusting of AI as a result. Managers have a much stronger preference for human-initiated or supervised AI, while Directors and above have a stronger preference for autonomous or semi-autonomous agents.\n\nOne way leaders may be able to overcome AI resistance is by using more tools that keep a human in the loop and allow workers to audit and participate in AI processes.\n\nMost businesses prioritize increasing productivity over replacing workers with AI\n\nWhat people are saying about AI & their workforces\nWe need to hire a dedicated team of individuals who solely work on AI.\nUnfortunately, it'll eliminate jobs behind the scenes, however, we will increase production therefore creating more jobs in the field.\nIt can streamline the repetitive and mundane tasks that can free up others to do things that are more important.\nImprove revenue. Higher profit margin. Proficiency without laying off staff with increase (in) business volume and revenue.\"\nI wish I could have AI do all the preliminary work required to find and hire potential new employees so I could deal with other things that also require my attention.\nAbility to increase the workload and results without increasing workforce, saving considerably on costs and infrastructure.\n\nMost businesses state their primary goal is to improve the efficiency and productivity of their existing teams with AI rather than replacing them.\n\nQualitatively, leaders do report anticipating changes to their workforce, but an equal number express anticipation that AI will add more specialized jobs, free up budget for additional roles, or just make existing jobs more focused on human-driven innovation.\n\nGiven the levels of confusion and worry around what AI is going to mean for people's jobs, leaders who want to adopt AI may want to consider communicating with their teams about how AI can improve existing roles and create new ones as the business grows. This reassurance may help allay fears and get more workers on board with the rollout of new tech.\n\nSome businesses do aim to reduce their workforce with AI\n\nWhat people are saying about reducing headcount with AI\n(I want to) identify redundant or unnecessary employees and terminate them.\nI believe that, given enough time, AI (will) greatly improve our business, but it might reduce our workforce.\nI wish we could fully run the wages and payments department with AI and no human interaction to reduce labour costs\nI wish we could reduce rote, low-value work currently performed by team members.\n\nHowever, some fears about job loss aren't unsupported. A small but consistent rate of 6-7% of respondents say that they do explicitly aim to reduce their workforce using AI.\n\nRetail, Media, and Real Estate are the top industries where reducing their workforce is a goal. Midsized companies are more likely to report wanting to reduce their workforce, as are companies that are the most price-sensitive when considering AI vendors."

    "text_chunk": "Conclusion: Leadership plays a critical role in the successful rollout of AI\nWe are in a critical stage of AI development in our workplaces. Businesses across the board are taking AI seriously as a tool, but not all of them are figuring out how to find success with it yet.\n\nThese findings make clear that leadership is vital to the success of AI within businesses.\n\nDon't leave something as important as AI adoption up to individuals and teams. The most impactful AI implementations are being rolled out from the top down. Not only that, but the more successful tools are the ones that are being developed and deployed intentionally and systematically.\n\nThey are tailored to your needs, targeted toward your pain points, and designed to increase efficiency across large swaths of your operations. Leaders also have the power and resources to invest in customized, integrated AI solutions that work more seamlessly with existing tools and processes.\n\nLeadership-level tools for better insight and decisions at the top are proving powerful. Custom AI agents that can be inserted directly into business processes are showing a meaningful impact. Partnerships with third-party experts, and giving teams no code tools they can use to fix their own problems independently are both helping businesses use AI more effectively.\n\nPeople aren't just tinkering with AI toys like ChatGPT. They're expecting you to introduce the tools they need to succeed. If your business wants to stay competitive, you, as a leader, should be employing all the tools you have at your disposal. In 2025, AI is clearly one of them.\n\n[Image: A black and white headshot of a smiling man in a collared shirt.]\nDavid Siegel CEO Glide\n\"Artificial intelligence, like steam or nuclear fission, is a raw force awaiting its engine.
