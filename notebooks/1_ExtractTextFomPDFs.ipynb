    "Extracting text from PDFs is challenging because these files may be scanned, have complex layouts, or contain unstructured data such as images and tables. When building a dataset to benchmark embedding models, it is important to avoid noisy, poorly formatted, or merged text between sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries like [PyMuPDF](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF), [PyPDF2](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf), and [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) can extract text from simple PDFs. However, they are ineffective when dealing with unstructured data or scanned documents. Embedding models, unlike LLMs, cannot interpret the context or structure of a document. They simply embed whatever text they receive, regardless of its quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the extracted text is clean and well-structured. Modern LLMs excel at reading images and understanding text, allowing us to leverage them to extract text from PDFs in a format that closely matches how a human would perceive the document."

      "Battery protection\n",
      "* Frequently charging a battery under high voltage may shorten the battery life. To protect the battery, once the battery is fully charged, the system may stop charging when the battery power is between 90% and 100%.\n",
      "\n",
      "NOTE: The level at which the battery resumes charging is usually set between 90% and 99%. The actual value may vary by model.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Charging or storing a battery in high ambient temperatures may result in permanent damage to the battery power capacity and rapidly shorten battery life. If the battery temperature is too high, the system may reduce the battery power charging capacity or even stop charging to protect the battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Battery power capacity may drop even when your device is powered off and disconnected from the AC power. This is normal as the system still draws a small amount of power from the battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Standard battery care\n",
      "* If you are not using your device for a long period of time, ensure to charge the battery power to 50% then power off your device and disconnect the AC power adapter. Recharge the battery power to 50% every three months to avoid over-discharging and prevent damage to the battery.\n",
      "* Avoid charging the battery at high voltage for a prolonged period of time to extend the battery life. If you are constantly using AC power for your device, ensure to discharge the battery power to 50% at least once every two weeks. You can also adjust the settings from Battery Health Charging in MyASUS to help extend the battery life.\n",
      "* It is recommended to store your battery at temperatures between 5°C (41°F) and 35°C (95°F) with the battery power at 50%. You can also adjust the settings from Battery Health Charging in MyASUS to help extend the battery life.\n",
      "* Do not leave your battery in damp environments. Exposure to damp environments may increase the battery over-discharging rate. Low temperature environment may damage the chemicals inside the battery while high temperature or overheating may result in a risk of explosion.\n",
      "* Do not place your device or battery pack near radiators, fireplaces, furnaces, heaters, or any sources of heat with temperature exceeding 60°C (140°F). High temperature surrounding environment may result in an explosion or leakage that may cause fire.\n",

      "Figure 2. Estimated captured flux of the planet assuming the planet radiates as a blackbody. The captured flux is calculated as the ratio of the integrated blackbody emission within the instrument's band pass to the total emission over all wavelengths, i.e., γ = ∫$_{λ}$$_{max}$$_{λ}$$_{min}$ B (λ,T) dλ/ ∫$_{0}$ ∞ B (λ,T) d λ . The captured flux fraction is shown for NIRISS SOSS [0.6-2.85 μ m] (red line); Hubble WFC3 [1.12-1.64 μ m] (dashed green line); NIRSpec G395H [2.7-5.15 μ m] (dash dotted blue line). The red-shaded region shows the temperature range on WASP-121 b based on T$_{eff}$ estimates. Red dashed lines indicate the boundaries of the planet's temperature range within the NIRISS SOSS captured flux fraction. From this we estimate that these observations capture between 55% and 82% of the planet's bolometric flux, depending on orbital phase. Using the minimum temperature from the NAMELESS fit, this estimate decreases to 50%. In either case, the wavelength coverage of NIRISS exceeds that of any other instrument.\n",
      "Pass et al. 2019 ). In this work, we elect to compute our effective temperature estimates with a novel method that is essentially a combination of the PWM and EWM. We create the effective temperature by using a simple Monte Carlo process. First, we perturb our F$_{p}$ / F$_{s}$ emission spectra at each point in the orbit by a Gaussian based on the measurement uncertainty. Our new emission spectrum is then used to create an estimate of the brightness temperature spectrum. This process is repeated at each orbital phase. We then estimate the effective temperature, T$_{eff}$ for a given orbital phase as\n",

      "where w$_{i}$ is the weight for the i -th wavelength given by the fraction of the planet's bolometric flux that falls within that wavelength bin scaled by the inverse variance of the measurement,\n",
      "w _ { i } = \\frac { \\int _ { \\lambda ^ { i + 1 } } ^ { \\lambda ^ { i + 1 } } B ( \\lambda _ { i } , T _ { \\text {est} } ) \\, d \\lambda } { \\int _ { 0 } ^ { \\infty } B ( \\lambda _ { i } , T _ { \\text {est} } ) \\, d \\lambda } \\cdot \\frac { 1 } { \\sigma _ { i } ^ { 2 } } ,\n",
