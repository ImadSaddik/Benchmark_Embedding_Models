    "Extracting text from PDFs is challenging because these files may be scanned, have complex layouts, or contain unstructured data such as images and tables. When building a dataset to benchmark embedding models, it is important to avoid noisy, poorly formatted, or merged text between sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries like [PyMuPDF](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF), [PyPDF2](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf), and [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) can extract text from simple PDFs. However, they are ineffective when dealing with unstructured data or scanned documents. Embedding models, unlike LLMs, cannot interpret the context or structure of a document. They simply embed whatever text they receive, regardless of its quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the extracted text is clean and well-structured. Modern LLMs excel at reading images and understanding text, allowing us to leverage them to extract text from PDFs in a format that closely matches how a human would perceive the document."

      "while the kernel weights are structured as $(N_{\\text{slice}}, N_{\\text{time}})$. This precomputation significantly accelerates our calculations, which is essential since the longitudinal slices are at least partially degenerate with one another. Consequently, the fits require more steps and walkers to ensure proper convergence.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address this, we follow a similar approach to our sinusoidal fits using emcee, but we increase the total number of steps to 100,000 and use 100 walkers. Naively, the fit would include $2N_{\\text{slice}} + 1$ parameters: $N_{\\text{slice}}$ for the albedo values, $N_{\\text{slice}}$ for the emission parameters, and one additional scatter parameter, $\\sigma$. However, since night-side slices do not contribute to the reflected light component, we exclude these albedo values from the fit. In any case, our choice of 100 walkers ensures a sufficient number of walkers per free parameter. Following Coulombe et al. (2025) we set an upper prior limit of $3/2$ on all albedo slices as a fully Lambertian sphere ($A_i = 1$) corresponds to a geometric albedo of $A_{g} = 2/3$. For thermal emission we impose a uniform prior between 0 and 500 ppm for each slice.\n",

      "We choose to fit our detrended lightcurves considering 4, 6 and 8 longitudinal slices ($N_{\\text{slice}} = 4, 6, 8$). However, we show the results of the simplest 4 slice model. As in our previous fits, we conduct an initial run with 25,000 steps (25% of the total run) and use the maximum-probability parameters from this preliminary fit as the starting positions for the final 75,000-step run. We then discard the first 60% of the final run as burn-in.\n",

In this work, we elect to compute our effective temperature estimates with a novel method that is essentially a combination of the PWM and EWM. We create the effective temperature by using a simple Monte Carlo process. First, we perturb our $F_{p}/F_{s}$ emission spectra at each point in the orbit by a Gaussian based on the measurement uncertainty. Our new emission spectrum is then used to create an estimate of the brightness temperature spectrum. This process is repeated at each orbital phase. We then estimate the effective temperature, $T_{\\text{eff}}$ for a given orbital phase as\n",

The captured flux is calculated as the ratio of the integrated blackbody emission within the instrument’s band pass to the total emission over all wavelengths, i.e., $\\gamma = \\int_{\\lambda_{\\text{min}}}^{\\lambda_{\\text{max}}} B(\\lambda, T) d\\lambda / \\int_{0}^{\\infty} B(\\lambda, T) d\\lambda$. The captured flux fraction is shown for NIRISS SOSS [0.6–2.85 μm] (red line); Hubble WFC3 [1.12–1.64 μm] (dashed green line); NIRSpec G395H [2.7–5.15 μm] (dash dotted blue line). The red-shaded region shows the temperature range on WASP-121 b based on our $T_{\\text{eff}}$ estimates. Red dashed lines indicate the boundaries of the planet’s temperature range within the NIRISS SOSS captured flux fraction. From this we estimate that these observations capture between 55% and 82% of the planet’s bolometric flux, depending on orbital phase. Using the minimum temperature from the NAMELESS fit, this estimate decreases to 50%. In either case, the wavelength coverage of NIRISS exceeds that of any other instrument.</img>\n"

      "*   Avoid charging the battery at high voltage for a prolonged period of time to extend the battery life. If you are constantly using AC power for your device, ensure to discharge the battery power to 50% at least once every two weeks. You can also adjust the settings from Battery Health Charging in MyASUS to help extend the battery life.\n",
      "*   It is recommended to store your battery at temperatures between 5°C (41°F) and 35°C (95°F) with the battery power at 50%. You can also adjust the settings from Battery Health Charging in MyASUS to help extend the battery life.\n",
      "*   Do not leave your battery in damp environments. Exposure to damp environments may increase the battery over-discharging rate. Low temperature environment may damage the chemicals inside the battery while high temperature or overheating may result in a risk of explosion.\n",
      "*   Do not place your device or battery pack near radiators, fireplaces, furnaces, heaters, or any sources of heat with temperature exceeding 60°C (140°F). High temperature surrounding environment may result in an explosion or leakage that may cause fire.\n",
