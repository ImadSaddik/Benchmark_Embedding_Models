    "Extracting text from PDFs is challenging because these files may be scanned, have complex layouts, or contain unstructured data such as images and tables. When building a dataset to benchmark embedding models, it is important to avoid noisy, poorly formatted, or merged text between sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries like [PyMuPDF](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF), [PyPDF2](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf), and [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) can extract text from simple PDFs. However, they are ineffective when dealing with unstructured data or scanned documents. Embedding models, unlike LLMs, cannot interpret the context or structure of a document. They simply embed whatever text they receive, regardless of its quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the extracted text is clean and well-structured. Modern LLMs excel at reading images and understanding text, allowing us to leverage them to extract text from PDFs in a format that closely matches how a human would perceive the document."

If the battery temperature is too high, the system may reduce the battery power charging capacity or even stop charging to protect the battery.\n",

      "*   If you are not using your device for a long period of time, ensure to charge the battery power to 50% then power off your device and disconnect the AC power adapter. Recharge the battery power to 50% every three months to avoid over-discharging and prevent damage to the battery.\n",
      "*   Avoid charging the battery at high voltage for a prolonged period of time to extend the battery life. If you are constantly using AC power for your device, ensure to discharge the battery power to 50% at least once every two weeks.
