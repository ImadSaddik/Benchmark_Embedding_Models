    "Extracting text from PDFs is challenging because these files may be scanned, have complex layouts, or contain unstructured data such as images and tables. When building a dataset to benchmark embedding models, it is important to avoid noisy, poorly formatted, or merged text between sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries like [PyMuPDF](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF), [PyPDF2](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf), and [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) can extract text from simple PDFs. However, they are ineffective when dealing with unstructured data or scanned documents. Embedding models, unlike LLMs, cannot interpret the context or structure of a document. They simply embed whatever text they receive, regardless of its quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the extracted text is clean and well-structured. Modern LLMs excel at reading images and understanding text, allowing us to leverage them to extract text from PDFs in a format that closely matches how a human would perceive the document."

      "    NOTE: The level at which the battery resumes charging is usually set between 90% and 99%. The actual value may vary by model.\n",
      "*   Charging or storing a battery in high ambient temperatures may result in permanent damage to the battery power capacity and rapidly shorten battery life. If the battery temperature is too high, the system may reduce the battery power charging capacity or even stop charging to protect the battery.\n",
      "*   Battery power capacity may drop even when your device is powered off and disconnected from the AC power. This is normal as the system still draws a small amount of power from the battery.\n",

      "Standard battery care\n",
      "*   If you are not using your device for a long period of time, ensure to charge the battery power to 50% then power off your device and disconnect the AC power adapter. Recharge the battery power to 50% every three months to avoid over-discharging and prevent damage to the battery.\n",
      "*   Avoid charging the battery at high voltage for a prolonged period of time to extend the battery life. If you are constantly using AC power for your device, ensure to discharge the battery power to 50% at least once every two weeks. You can also adjust the settings from Battery Health Charging in MyASUS to help extend the battery life.\n",
      "*   It is recommended to store your battery at temperatures between 5Â°C (41Â°F) and 35Â°C (95Â°F) with the battery power at 50%. You can also adjust the settings from Battery Health Charging in MyASUS to help extend the battery life.\n",
      "*   Do not leave your battery in damp environments. Exposure to damp environments may increase the battery over-discharging rate. Low temperature environment may damage the chemicals inside the battery while high temperature or overheating may result in a risk of explosion.\n",
      "*   Do not place your device or battery pack near radiators, fireplaces, furnaces, heaters, or any sources of heat with temperature exceeding 60Â°C (140Â°F). High temperature surrounding environment may result in an explosion or leakage that may cause fire.\n",
