# Benchmarking embedding models

![Cover image](./images/thumbnail.jpg)

Welcome to the repository! This is a project inspired by the work I did for the company that I work for. The goal of this project is to create a golden dataset from your or your company's data, and then use it to benchmark different embedding models.

Still a work in progress.
